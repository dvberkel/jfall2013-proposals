node.js for if you are in a hurry

Description
-----------

JavaScript is climbing the Tiobe index and for good reasons. With the
onset of node.js JavaScript has matured from a script kiddie language
into a well established tool with a vibrant community. But what does

In this session we will expose the fundamentals of JavaScript via
node.js. We will identify the strong points of the node.js platform
and discuss the challenges a developer faces when using it.

We will provide a Java developer with the means to hit the ground

The rational of the node community to offering small

depend on these modules.

During a life coding session we will highlight the interesting parts

platform and contrast this with more tradintional platforms.

We will end the session with an exposition of the tools that are
create for and on the node.js platform that will accelerate
