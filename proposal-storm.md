Title
-----

Taking the web by storm

Description
-----------

Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation
system. It allows a developer to define sources of data, called
sprouts, and hook up various data-transformers, called bolts into a
distributed computing graph.

In this session we will explain how Storm can be leverage to perform
intricate realtime computations by introducing the fundamentals of
storm. Via life coding session we will show how to implement various
part in a storm topology and how to test and deploy a the specification.

We will provide a Java developer with a great cloud computing tool in
a world which becomes progressivly more cloud based.

Project Outline
---------------

We will introduce the terms and concept used by storm and how the can
be combined to form a computing topology. We will focus on the
distributed nature of Storm and mention several examples of use-cases.

Via a life coding session we will provide deeper insight into the
implementation details of construction sprouts, bolts and
topology. Hereby exposing the internal domain specific language Storm
provides for configuring topologies.

We will demonstrate how to deploy a Storm topology in the cloud and
what tools are available to monitor the performance of the
configuration. We will end the session with a discussion of pitfalls,
considerations and a Q&A.
